First it is a way to spread ideas about things you care about (political, social, economic causes as well as personal hobbies and interest) to other social media networks that you rarely, if ever use. What this does it is exposes your ideas and yourself to people who otherwise you may never interact with or come across on the internet with because they primarily or only use Facebook, Twitter, and/or LinkedIn. Second I think this is a way to build a kind of Google+ cyber bridge with Facebook, Twitter, and/or LinkedIn. In other words this is a way to get curious individuals who use these other social media networks to check out Google Plus (since it shows your original G+ post link) and organically grow the user base of Gplus by real experience and word of mouth. So I think it both helps you as an individual G+ user and at the same time helps the overall G+ social media network grow and expand with new users.﻿"
